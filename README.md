Sudoku w/ Backbone.js
===============

Simple soduko game built in Backbone.js

Its built with backbone.js and bootstrap.

### Itch
This a simple experiment to see how I could impliment a
sudoku puzzle in Backbone. It uses basic models and collections
to setup the puzzle.

During the flight to Ireland for the NodeConf.eu conference I was
bored during take off and started to work on the sudoku puzzle in the
back of the inflight magazine. I hate sodukos but was interested
in figuring how to determine the level of difficulty of a given puzzle.

### Conclusion

I figured the process of building the game would help me understand
how to rate a puzzle. Turns out the number difficulty is determine
by the number of seed numbers in the puzzle.

* Fewer seeds are earier.
* More seeds are harder.
* Too many seeds make it easy again.
